    For Week 4, we're required to create a coding quiz with dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by Javascript. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

# About the Project

## Requirements: User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Requirements: Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements for this week's portfolio work:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

### Built With

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* [JS](https://www.javascript.com/)

This week, the code quiz consists of HTML, CSS and Javascipt elements that we've learned so far in class. It will feature a countdown timer, along with local storage for keeping high score, as well as dynamic quiz text elements.
